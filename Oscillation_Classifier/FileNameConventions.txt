CSV files are named using the following format.
#layers_resolution_valuerange_timerange.csv

ex. 6_low_2-8_late.csv
  represents a 6 layer hierarchy with spacing of .1, value range of .2-.8 run over the last 50 years.

sigma = .3 for all

#layers:
  number of layers in the hierarchy.
  ex. 2, 6


resolution:
  spacing between bias and homophily values
  ex:
    low = .1
    med = .05
    high = .01


valuerange:
  range of bias and homophily values same decimal notation as resolution but 1 => 1 NOT .1
  given in the format start-end, assumes same range for bias and homophily
  ex. 5-65


timerange:
  years over which standard deviation is taken
  ex:
    late = last 50 years
    early = first 100 years
    full = entire range
