CSV files are named using the following format.
#layers_resolution_valuerange_timerange_InitialCondition.csv

ex. 6_low_20-80_30-70_late_40.csv
  represents a 6 layer hierarchy with spacing of .1, value range of .2-.8 bias and .3-.7 homophily run over the last 50 years
  starting with .4 women in the lowest layer.

sigma = .3 for all

#layers:
  number of layers in the hierarchy.
  ex. 2, 6


resolution:
  spacing between bias and homophily values 3 decimal places
  ex:
    100 = .1
    050 = .05
    005 = .005


valuerange:
  range of bias and homophily values same decimal notation as resolution but 1 => 1 NOT .1
  given in the format start-end
  ex. 50-65_65_80


timerange:
  years over which standard deviation is taken
  ex:
    late = last 50 years
    early = first 100 years
    full = entire range
