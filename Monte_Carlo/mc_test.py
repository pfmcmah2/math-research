# PERSON CLASS
#   1 int 1 bool, [years to retirement (yr), Gender (g)]
#   example: Person12 = [17, man]
#
# LAYER
#   1 list of persons people in layer[]
#       By construction list is ordered by seniority
#           Acts a priority queue with no aditional overhead
#   example: Layer3 = [[3, woman], [11, man], [9, man], [23, woman]]
#   number of women in each layer is stored in a seperate array
#
# Layer has a preset size, cannot be changed
# At each year:
#   Decrement all persons yr by 1
#       If yr = 0: remove person
#   Starting with top layer fill all vacant spots using model
#       Promoting a person is done by copying them into the higher layer and
#       deleting them from the lower layer

# Notes:
#   Choosing an initial yr value for all people is tricky
#       Could be based on layer
#   Choosing yr for a new person is done randomly, exponential distribution?
#   Only ratio of layer size matters, larger layers => higher "resolution"
